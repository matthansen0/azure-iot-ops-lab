Spin up an Ubuntu VM and let it **self‚Äëprovision** an end‚Äëto‚Äëend **Azure IoT Operations** (AIO) lab: K3s, Arc connect, AIO foundation, the **embedded quickstarts** (devices, assets, data flow), and a simulator ‚Äî all from **Azure Cloud Shell** with two scripts. Tear it down with one more.

---

## ‚ú® What this automates

- **Arc‚Äëenable** a K3s cluster and turn on **cluster‚Äëconnect** + **custom locations** features.  
- Deploy **Azure IoT Operations** (foundation + instance).  
- Run the two **official AIO quickstarts** end‚Äëto‚Äëend (this repo embeds their steps):
  - **[Deploy AIO (quickstart)](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/iot-operations/)** 
  - **[Configure your cluster (quickstart)](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/iot-operations/get-started-end-to-end-sample/quickstart-configure)**

> [!NOTE]
> *There is existing automated builds in the above documentation to run this in Codespaces, but the purpose of this repo is to build it out in a VM for a longer-term lab.*

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Prerequisite: Azure CLI Login

The assumption is that this deployment will be done from bash in Azure Cloud Shell. Even if you are in Cloud Shell already, it's a good idea before running the deployment script to make sure that you've logged in to Azure CLI, to set the subscription and get a refreshed token:

```bash
az login
```

---

## üîí Lab Security notes

- This lab uses your own Azure user credentials for all operations.
- SSH access to the VM is opened via a Network Security Group (NSG) rule.
- A local SSH key pair is generated on your local machine for authentication.

## üß™ Quick start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/matthansen0/azure-iot-ops-lab.git
cd azure-iot-ops-lab
chmod +x deploy.sh destroy.sh
```

```bash
# Deploy the VM and copy the install script
./deploy.sh \
  --subscription "<SUB_ID>" \
  --location "eastus2" \
  --compute-rg "rg-aioCompute" \
  --ops-rg "rg-aioOps" \
  --vm-name "aio24" \
  --ssh-public-key "$HOME/.ssh/id_rsa.pub" \
  --storage-account "aio$(date +%s)" \
  --schema-registry "aioqs-sr" \
  --schema-namespace "aioqs-ns"
```

### SSH into the VM and run the install script

```bash
ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa azureuser@<VM_PUBLIC_IP>
```

```bash
#Execute the script, authorized via device code.
sudo bash /usr/local/bin/aio-install.sh
```

The script will prompt you to authenticate with Azure using a device code, and will take between 30-45 minutes to complete.

### Verify (optional)

```bash
# On the VM (or via Arc)
kubectl get nodes
kubectl get pods -n azure-iot-operations
kubectl get pods -n azure-arc-containerstorage
kubectl get pods -n cert-manager

# In Azure
az iot ops list -g rg-aioOps -o table
```

> View install logs on the VM:
>
> ```bash
> tail -40 /var/log/aio-install.log
> ```

> [!TIP]
> You will be able to see finalized progress of the deployment once there is device messages being sent into the IoT Hub.

## üóëÔ∏è Clean up

```bash
./destroy.sh --compute-rg "rg-aioCompute" --ops-rg "rg-aioOps"
```
